        <h2>Who is kollektiv orangotango?</h2>
        <p>
            Kollektiv orangotango was founded in 2008. Since then it has been constantly developing 
            through a network of critical geographers, friends and activists who deal with questions 
            regarding space, power and re­sistance. With our geographical activism, we seek to support 
            processes and oppositional actors who instigate social change by prefiguring social 
            alternatives. We conduct emancipatory educational work as well as con­crete political and 
            artistic interventions. These are supposed to enforce reflections on and changes of social 
            conditions. Through workshops, publications, mappings, excursions, and creative in­terventions 
            within public space, we collectively learn how to read space and how to initiate emancipatory 
            processes from below. By sticking to the traditions of activist research, we connect 
            theoret­ical reflections and concrete actions.<br><br>

            So far we have engaged in the fields of right to the city, (urban) agriculture, critical 
            pedagogy, alternative housing and solidarity economy, mostly in Europe and also in Latin 
            America. But kollektiv orangotango also functions as a platform for dif­ferent actions. 
            In the case of Not-an-Atlas, its publication was realized by kollektiv orangotango in 
            cooperation with other activists and academics. That is the reason why it was named 
            kollektiv orangotango+. <br><br>

            All of this is happen­ing through collective and self-organized practice. In other 
            words: “We’re going slow, because we’re going far”! <br><br>

            <h2>How to Edit and Reflect Counter-Cartographies Collectively as Activists and Academics?</h2>

            Both our activist experiences with collective and critical mapping workshops as kollektiv
            orangotango as well as our individual and academic engagements with maps served as starting
            points for Not-an-Atlas. In the spring of 2015 we released a <a href = "http://kritische-karten.net/index.php/call-for-papers/">
            Call for Maps in English, German and Spanish</a>, inviting everyone engaged with practices of critical mapping to send 
            us ideas, texts, photos and, of course, maps. We were overwhelmed by the resonance! Nearly 
            150 submissions found their way to us. Some of them came from places, struggles and activists 
            we had not heard of before; oth­ers came from long-time companions and friends. Among them were 
            contributions from well-known critical cartographers, ac­tivists, and social movements who 
            have been working with maps for many years; but even more emerging mapmakers sent us their 
            proposals. What followed were exciting three years of discussing, selecting and editing the 
            various maps and projects. Again and again we had to ask ourselves: What actually makes a 
            map (not) critical? And what do we (not) have in mind when working on a counter-atlas? We 
            also had to continually negotiate between more activist and more academic modes of knowledge 
            production – be it in regards to the content of the maps or in regards to our own mode of 
            working and living. With the large number of submis­sions, Not-an-Atlas quickly outgrew its 
            initial frame in terms of involved languages, time and resources. The resulting process of 
            collective learning therefore included various challenges, personal fluctuations and surprises. 
            There we started to think about an online version of Not-an-Atlas. So we understand 
            <a href = "https://notanatlas.org"> notanatlas.org </a> as a continuation of the Not-an-Atlas book. Because we want to continue 
            to share maps, struggles, projects, texts and inspirations online.
